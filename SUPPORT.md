# Need help with Keycloak?

Welcome to the Keycloak community. We are here to help, but please be respectful, and also remember that we simply may not have time or capacity to answer every question.

Before asking for help, please check out the [documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation), see if your question has already been answered, and try searching for the solution.

For general help and questions the best place to ask is through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/q-a). We also have a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keycloak-user) if you prefer that.

For any security sensitive questions or issues, please refer to our [Security Policy](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/security/policy) on how to disclose these in a responsible way.
